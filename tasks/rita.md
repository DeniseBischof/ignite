## GENERAL

### CONCEPT
- We developed different concepts in the beginning. 
- I created a system in miro board to guide our brainstorming process.
- I tried to guide the process of looking for an idea. I might be more comfortable with situations when it looks like we are standing in nothing, and it's still not a reason to settle for a shortcut.
- I tried to oversee the project as a whole, and always make sure that the message we are trying to communicate is still clear in every aspect. 
- I initiated some conversations during the process, when we had to clarify ourselves more and more precisely what we are doing and why, who is the target group, how we want the users to feel. 

### ORGANISATION/ WORK STRUCTURE
- I attended almost every group meeting. I tried to be active during the meetings.
- I also attended almost every external meeting, as I've been working closely with Flo doing the illustrations, my friends have been working on the sound, with Klara mostly the 2 of us managed the application for 48h Neukölln, and I also met our future help, Marie, for building the installation.  
- I used my social network to find applicants for the interviews, 2 already happened, and 2 are in progress. 
- I initiated to apply to 48 hours of Neukölln as well. I looked into what is needed, I created a structure for the application text, we discussed it with Klara, I wrote some part of it, I collected our team's biography, and I created the visuals and the whole look of the presenation for it. I made the hygene plan look nice as well. I checked the whole application, and I supported Klara sending it. 
- I am Captain Installation, which I didn't do too well yet, mostly because I thought as the website team is based on my work with it's visual style, it's better if I do that well first, and realizing the installation can be delayed in time, as that is kind of the last step of our project.
