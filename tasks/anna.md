# TASKS

## GENERAL

#### CONCEPT
- We developed different concepts in the beginning. We had the idea of everyone living in their own bubble with their own problems and we all thought about some possible topics. Jack brought up micro aggressions and I suggested focusing on this topic alone (since it is very strong and comprehensive itself) instead of having a lot of big topics that we can't really cover or give justice to.
- From then on we developed it all together and everybody gave their input
- We brainstormed together about the title for weeks until we found one


#### ORGANISATION/ WORK STRUCTURE
- I mostly moderated/guided our meetings
- I checked the intentions within the group to clarify the individual tasks

## WEBSITE
- We all searched for other websites as inspiration and moods
- I created the web visualisation for our website. This was a lot of research on the look and performance for web-based particles
- I learned the basics of react
- I worked on the communication between the database and the visualisation with Ellina
- We spent a lot of time on dicussing the website layout and design, the design of the illustrations, and the user interaction

## INTERVIEWS
- Rita suggested only using the audio or to alienate the footage in some way and we discussed and brainstormed about the idea. (Elaborate more, why..)
- I encouraged eveybody to ask around for possible interviewees
- We all discussed possible questions for the individual interviewees as well as the professional organisation
- I defined the [technical setup/ guidline for conducting the interviews ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HA190BUDEBigxHGpKLe4tG7bKwOXOTPoK0li0lYYFZQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- I conducted some of the interviews
- I edited interviews
- I suggested putting up the audio file underneath a written question on the website to structure it and have shorter audio files as a result

## INSTALLATION
- We all added moods for the installation setup
- Rita and I brainstormed a lot about setup, projection, user experience
- Rita and I did some projection tests on a white sheet. I took photos and videos of it and edited them.
- I looked up the studio layout and size, as well as communicating with Sehs√ºchte (GeKo).
- I built a miniature installation with Rita and Denise. I took photos and videos of it and edited them.

## VISUALISATION
- We all added moods for the visualisation to the miro board
- Zainab was in charge of the visualisation I mostly just gave her my opinion on the results

## SOUND
- I added some moods for the "nice" atmospheric sound for the "not nice" sounds to the miro board 
- I attended most of the sound meetings with Julia and Felix, who created the sound design
- We discussed topics like the length and the suspense curve of the audio, using headphones or speakers, the mood it should portray,.. 
- I gave feedback to their results

## CONTENT
- I wasn't part of creating the text content for the website, but I proofread it
- I educated myself more about the topic and talked to a lot of friends about it

# Conclusion
I think this is one of the best group projects I've ever been apart of. The flat hierarchy worked extremly well. I sort of took the lead in managing all of our meetings and generally taking the producer role, but it wasn't such a big role since we had a captain for each departement anyways. Everybody was in charge of a departement, so the responsibility was clear and well distributed. However, one could still be part of any team to share their opinion without having to actively work on it. So for example I was on the sound team, where I looked up sound moods and expressed my thoughts, but I dindn't create the actual sound design. This way everyone felt very integrated in what interests them about the project.
